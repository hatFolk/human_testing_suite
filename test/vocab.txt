What are expressions and how do they differ from statements?


***Expressions are a combination of values, variables, operators, and function
calls that are interpreted (evaluated/resolved) and returns a value.
Statements are 'verbs' in programming which do the actual work of a program.
***Expressions are control structures and statements are operators.
***Expressions are 'verbs' in programming which do the actual work of a
program.
Statements are a combination of statements, variables, operators, and
function calls that are evaluated and returned as a value.
***There's no difference!


What are three types of errors and what do they do?


***Syntax errors: Incorrect syntax due to spelling, missing operators.
Runtime errors: Code was compiled, but crashes at some point when run.
Logic errors: Code runs without crashing, but doesn't do what you want.
***Easy to Fix: Bad syntax and operators in the code
So-So to Fix: Code crashes but it gives you a traceback.
Hard to fix: Code crashes and it doesn't give you a traceback.
***Writing error: Code is syntactically and grammatically incorrect.
Runtime error: Code has a lot of run-on sentences.
Logic error: Code makes invalid points about a topics


What are variables?


***Names that refer to spots in memory. When used, its value is looked up in
memory and checks the current value.
***Representation of values which could be simplified to a single value.
***Different types of functions


What is overloading?


***The ability of one function/method/operator to perform different tasks.
***Putting too many elements in a list
***When an object's method is implemented and used instead of its parent's.


Assume we have a list called xs. What's the difference between updating xs and
reassigning xs?


***Updating xs changes values but keeps the list in the same memory address.
Reassigning xs moves xs's address entirely.
***Updating and Reassigning are the same thing.
***Reassigning xs modifies the list, but keeps it in place.
Updating xs is completely re-writing xs.


What does it mean when an object is immutable?


***The object is unable to be changed once set.
***The object is able to be modified once s et.
***It means you can turn it to gold.
***It doesn't mean you can't modify it.


What is mutability?


***The property of being changeable.
