What are literals?


***Notation for representing a fixed value in source code.
For example, when you want a 2, you literally write a 2.
When you want a string, you have to do something like "this".
***What we call different types of strings.
For example, you can do 'Text', "Text" and """Text""", but not
'Text" or "Text' etc.

of value.

What are booleans and what are the boolean literals?


***A binary variable, having two values of either True or False.
***A type of circuit, based off of digital algebra.
***A band led by George Boole, popular back in 1855.


What are expressions and how do they differ from statements?


***Expressions are a combination of values, variables, operators, and function
calls that are interpreted (evaluated/resolved) and returns a value.
Statements are 'verbs' in programming which do the actual work of a program.
***Expressions are control structures and statements are operators.
***Expressions are 'verbs' in programming which do the actual work of a
program.
Statements are a combination of statements, variables, operators, and
function calls that are evaluated and returned as a value.
***There's no difference!


What are three types of errors and what do they do?


***Syntax errors: Incorrect syntax due to spelling, missing operators.
Runtime errors: Code was compiled, but crashes at some point when run.
Logic errors: Code runs without crashing, but doesn't do what you want.
***Easy to Fix: Bad syntax and operators in the code
So-So to Fix: Code crashes but it gives you a traceback.
Hard to fix: Code crashes and it doesn't give you a traceback.
***Writing error: Code is syntactically and grammatically incorrect.
Runtime error: Code has a lot of run-on sentences.
Logic error: Code makes invalid points about a topics


What are variables?


***Names that refer to spots in memory. When used, its value is looked up in
memory and checks the current value.
***Representation of values which could be simplified to a single value.
***Different types of functions


What is overloading?


***The ability of one function/method/operator to perform different tasks.
***Putting too many elements in a list
***When an object's method is implemented and used instead of its parent's.


Assume we have a list called xs. What's the difference between updating xs and
reassigning xs?


***Updating xs changes values but keeps the list in the same memory address.
Reassigning xs moves xs's address entirely.
***Updating and Reassigning are the same thing.
***Reassigning xs modifies the list, but keeps it in place.
Updating xs is completely re-writing xs.


What does it mean when an object is immutable?


***The object is unable to be changed once set.
***The object is able to be modified once s et.
***It means you can turn it to gold.
***It doesn't mean you can't modify it.


What is mutability?


***The property of being changeable.
***The property of being unchanging
***It doesn't exist


What is the difference between ints and floats?


***Ints are base 10 numbers. They are Integers.
However, floats are an approximation of Real Numbers. They are Reals.
***Ints are base 5 numbers. They are integers.
However, floats are an approximation of real decimals. They are decimals.
***Floats are base 16 numbers. They are floats.
However, ints are an approximation of real numbers. They are integers.
***Ints and floats are the same.
***Ints int and Floats float.


What are expressions?


***Representation of values that can be reduced down to some value.
It can include lots of things, so long as it reduces to a value.
***These are instructions to a computer to do something.
***It's a turn of speech that people use to express themselves.
***It's a turn of speech that computers use to express themselves.


What does the following do in an interpreter?
	>>> x = 5
	>>> x + 4


***x gains the value 5. A command is then issued to show x + 4.
The result is 9. x does not store the value 9.
***x gains the value 5. A command is then ordered to assign x to x + 4.
x is now 9.
***Exception. x is not defined
***Exception. x is not used
***x = 9


Which of the following is considered sequential program flow?


***x = 5
y = 5
x += 5
x /= 2
y %= 3
print(x, y)
# Because all lines have the same indentation level
***x = 5
if(x < 5):
	print(x)
else:
	print("hi")
# Because different blocks of code run based on True or False
***x = 5
while x < 10:
	print(x)
	x+= 1
#Because it repeats the same block of code until the condition is met


Which of the following is considered selection statement-based flow?


***x = input()
if x == "h":
	print(x)
elif x == "e":
	print("Meep")
else:
	print("No")


What's the difference between an indefinite and a definite loop?


***A definite loop does a task a set number of times.
An indefinite loop checks a condition and could go on forever.
***An indefinite loop does not check a condition and goes on forever.
A definite loop checks a condition a set unmber of times
***A definition loop does a loop-di-loop
