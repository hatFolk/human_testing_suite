Tests
=====
This file holds pre-made tests. Mostly for python knowledge.


How to make your own Test:

1. Make a text file
2. Write a question.
3. Make sure that there are two empty lines between your question and where your answers are going to be.
4. Everytime you want to indicate what you have is a new multiple choice: At the beginning of the choice, use this: `***`. See example.txt for other things you can theoretically do.
5. The first multiple choice you write is considered the correct answer. The rest are phonies to make your testing a little harder.
6. Make phonies
7. If done making questions and answers, Save and Quit. Else, go to step 2. Make sure there are two empty lines between your answers and your questions...
