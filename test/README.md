Tests
=====
This file holds pre-made tests. Mostly for python knowledge.


How to make your own Test:

1. Make a text file
2. Write a question.
3. Make sure that there are two empty lines between your question and where your answers are going to be.
4. Everytime you want to indicate what you have is a new multiple choice: At the beginning of the choice, use this:
	`***`
	4a. See example.txt in the test directory for details.
5. The first multiple choice you write is considered the correct answer. The rest are phonies to make your testing a little harder.
