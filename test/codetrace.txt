Consider the following definitions:

    tup = ((), [], ("bob", 90), (23, "duck"))
    xs = [1, 2, (3,), [7, 8, 9], 10+11, 12, "yes", 14, "15"]
    string = "32 doggies"

What is the value of the following?:
    xs[4]


***21
***[7, 8, 9]
***7
***10


Consider the following definitions:

    tup = ((), [], ("bob", 90), (23, "duck"))
    xs = [1, 2, (3,), [7, 8, 9], 10+11, 12, "yes", 14, "15"]
    string = "32 doggies"

What is the value of the following?:
    tup[1:3][1][-1]


***90
***("bob", 90)
***"bob"
***23
***"duck"


Consider the following definitions:

    tup = ((), [], ("bob", 90), (23, "duck"))
    xs = [1, 2, (3,), [7, 8, 9], 10+11, 12, "yes", 14, "15"]
    string = "32 doggies"

What is the value of the following?:
    tup[xs[1]][0]


***"bob"
***Exception!
***[2]
***2
***("bob", 90)


Assume that the following happened:
	xs = [1, 2, 3]
	ys = xs
	xs[0] = 3
	print(ys == xs)
	print(xs)
	print(ys)
What is the ouput?


***True
[3, 2, 3]
[3, 2, 3]
***False
[3, 2, 3]
[1, 2, 3]
***True
[1, 2, 3]
[1, 2, 3]
***False
[1, 2, 3]
[3, 2, 3]
