# for-loop example that counts up.


num = int(input ("starting from zero, how high should I count? "))

for i in range(num+1):
    print (i)

print ("\n(all done!)\n")


#MODS and Qs:

# What is the type of range(num) ?

# What order are the elements of range(num) visited?

# For flexibility's sake, try using a variable instead
# of range(num) in the for loop.

# Isn't this more streamlined than either the sequential 
# or while-loop versions?
