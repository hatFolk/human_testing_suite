# while-loop example.  We'll see how this can be done better.

num = int(input ("how high should I count?"))



counter = 0

while (counter <= num):
    print (counter)
    counter += 1

print ("(all done!)")


#MODS and Qs:

# let's do all the printing once (outside the loop).

# don't print the numbers on separate lines.

# can we phrase how many times the loop will run?
# --> is the loop 'definite' or 'indefinite'?
