Human Testing Suite
=====

A Python3 based Multiple Choice Testing Suite.
This is designed to be more or less readable for beginners as well as being a helpful guide on several topics:

* OOP
* Functions
* Studying
* Anything else I can find in my notes

How to use it:
    Feed to hts.py any number of filenames. It will convert the files sequentially to test suites and the user will be asked questions based on the suite generated.
    The questions are randomized as are the choices.

    Run using "python3 hts.py <filenames>"

To Do:

Auto-format questions to about 80 characters.
Question elimination
