Human Testing Suite
=====

A Python3 based Multiple Choice Testing Suite.
This is designed to be more or less readable for beginners as well as being a helpful guide on several topics:

* OOP
* Functions
* Studying
* Anything else I can find in my notes

It is also designed to be imported into other script as part of a larger testing unit.
Suggestions always welcome on how to make it more flexible for wider use.

How to use it:
	You can download the zip file on the sidebar. Unzip it.

    Feed to hts.py any number of filenames. It will convert the files sequentially to test suites and the user will be asked questions based on the suite generated.
    The questions are randomized as are the choices.

	So, in order to run it, you need to use the command prompt to do the command below
    Run using "python3 hts.py <filenames>"
	(Where <filenames> is replaced by the test file.)

Mini-tutorial on how to run this with a file in the tests directory:
	If you want to run a test that's already been pre-made, do :

	"python3 hts.py tests/<name of file>"
