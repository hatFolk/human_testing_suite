Human Testing Suite
=====

A Python3 based Multiple Choice Testing Suite.
This is designed to be more or less readable for beginners as well as being a helpful guide on several topics:

* OOP
* Functions
* Studying
* Anything else I can find in my notes

It is also designed to be imported into other script as part of a larger testing unit.
Suggestions always welcome on how to make it more flexible for wider use.

How to use it:
    Feed to hts.py any number of filenames. It will convert the files sequentially to test suites and the user will be asked questions based on the suite generated.
    The questions are randomized as are the choices.

    Run using "python3 hts.py <filenames>"
